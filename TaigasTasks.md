1. Implement a webserver with /hello and /query_firestore url handlers
    in *one* of the language directories, whichever you like.
    * /hello responds with a static web page.
    * /query_firestore executes a firestore query
      that returns one result, and responds with a web page containing the
      result. 

2. Implement the Proctor in Python, NodeJS, or C# (your choice).
    Read /Proctor/REQUIREMENTS.md for more details.
